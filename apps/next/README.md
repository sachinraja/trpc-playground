# next-app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It is meant for testing the Next.js api handler. For developing the components with HMR and testing the Express handler, use the [Vite app](https://github.com/sachinraja/trpc-playground/tree/main/apps/vite).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/api/trpc-playground with your browser to see the playground.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
